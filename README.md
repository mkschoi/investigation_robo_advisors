# Robo Advisors
## *Intersection of Asset Management and Machine Learning*

### Summary

As my investigation. I chose to look into robo-advisors to understand how machine learning is applied under the hood in this relatively nascent industry. A robo-advisor is an online investment platform that provides automated investment advice and uses machine learning algorithms to determine asset allocations and rebalancing for investors. 

There are two places where data science is applied. The first stage is in the initial investor profiling stage when the robo advisor collects information about its customer.  The current trend you are seeing is that robo advisors are replacing questionnaires with data mining from more sophisticated data sources, to improve the quality of the inputs for their models.

Another application of data science comes into play in the portfolio optimization stage.  The main question is how do you maximize the expected return of a portfolio for a given level of risk?  The robo-advisors utilizes various statistical models such as mean-variance, Black-Letterman, and full-scale optimization model, in order to find the most optimal weights for the securities in the portfolio that maximize return per unit of risk.  Please click the links to my blog post and notebook below to see a code-walkthrough of a simple robo-advisor algorithm I have created.  

Finally, the future of robo-advisors will involve a lot more sophisticated application of machine learning, like leveraging more big data, voice recognition, and using deep-learning to identify individual stocks based on valuation.  One interesting trend is that robo-advisors are incorporating a human element to their services, which seems sort of paradoxical but there are times in a customerâ€™s investing journey where you need a human advisor to talk to, for example, like hand-holding you during a market turmoil.
